          (“<strong>SP</strong>”) in their mini app environment and access services or purchase goods directly from such
          Service Providers using Telegram apps.</p>
        <p>These Terms of Service for Mini Apps (“<strong>MA Terms</strong>”) govern your usage of the Telegram Mini App
          Feature (“<strong>MAF</strong>”) provided by Telegram Messenger Inc. (“<strong>Telegram</strong>”) and
          constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Telegram. For the purposes of these terms, ‘we’, ‘us’
          and ‘our’ refers to Telegram, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the MAF.</p>

              class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1. Acceptance of MA Terms</h1>
        <p>By using the MAF, you agree that you have read in full, understood and accepted to be legally bound by the
          terms contained herein, in addition to <a href="https://telegram.org/tos">Telegram’s Terms of Service</a>, <a
            href="https://telegram.org/privacy">Telegram’s Privacy Policy</a> and the respective Terms of Service of
          each MA you access, if any. All of the aforementioned terms may be amended from time to time without notice.
          Should you decide to purchase goods through a MA, you may further be subject to the Terms of Service of the
          provider that will process your payment, as agreed between you and the payment provider.</p>
        <p>For clarity, your continued access to and use of MAF shall constitute your acceptance of these MA Terms and

          time.</p>
        <h1><a class="anchor" name="2-mini-apps" href="#2-mini-apps"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2. Mini Apps</h1>
        <p>All products and services offered via MAF are offered and managed by third-party SP. These SP are also
          responsible for any continued operation and maintenance for their MA on the Telegram platform. We are not
          affiliated with any of these SP, and they operate independently of Telegram. By using MAF on the Telegram
          platform, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are accessing a third-party service directly from its SP;</li>
          <li>Telegram only provides SP with access to third-party payment providers via its <a
              href="https://telegram.org/privacy#7-third-party-payment-services">Payment Platform</a>, and does not
            itself process payments or hold funds;</li>
          <li>SP may have additional terms as a part of their products or services with which you must comply;</li>
          <li>You fully acknowledge and explicitly assume any and all risks related to transactions with SP, and agree
            that we shall not be liable for any risks or adverse consequences arising from such transactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The individual SP that operate MA are solely responsible for the content, products, goods, or services made
          available to you directly via their respective MA – including but not limited to quality, performance and
          availability. You should contact the respective SP directly with any queries, and any disputes shall be
          resolved directly with the respective SP.</p>
        <p>Cancellations or refunds for purchases from SP via MAF are subject to the applicable terms of the specific SP
          from which the purchase was made. Telegram has no role in processing payments and governing refund or
          cancellation charges. Any disputes must be resolved by contacting the SP directly, who is responsible for
          resolving the dispute.</p>
        <h1><a class="anchor" name="3-payments" href="#3-payments"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3. Payments</h1>
        <p>Telegram does not process payments. Instead, payments are processed by third-party payment providers, which
          are chosen by the SP for their MA, at the SP’s sole discretion, from the list of <a
            href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#supported-payment-providers">available payment providers</a>.
        </p>

              class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3.1. Payment Information</h4>
        <p>Telegram does not store your credit card details for purchases made via MAF. Such data is handled solely by
          third-party payment providers. See our <a
            href="https://telegram.org/privacy#7-third-party-payment-services">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

              class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3.2. Payment-Related Disputes</h4>
        <p>Payments conducted or initiated through a MA are processed by a third-party payment provider, as agreed
          between you, the SP and the payment provider, which at times may coincide.</p>
        <p>Telegram does not handle, manage, oversee, verify or provide any sort of warranty over such transactions.
          Consequently, any disputes, claims, losses, misunderstandings, technical errors, or issues of any kind (both
          accidental and allegedly intentional) related to payments or transactions must be directed towards the
          respective payment provideror SP. Telegram bears no responsibility whatsoever and will not be a party to any
          payment-related disputes or discussions, nor is it liable for any losses or damages the parties involved may
          incur.</p>

          Data We Share</h4>
        <p>When you interact with a MA, it will automatically acquire your IP address. Additionally, depending on which
          MA you use and how it was opened, we may also share some basic data with it, like your Telegram user id,
          public Telegram name, username and profile picture, an IETF language tag of your client language, your premium
          subscription status and some color parameters related to your in-app theme. </p>
        <p>MA launched from the attachment menu in private chats will also receive similar information about your chat
          partner. MA launched from the attachment menu in channels and group chats may also receive the ID, type,
          title, username and photo of the chat in which they were opened.</p>
        <p>By utilizing the MAF, you expressly acknowledge and understand that such data will be shared with the SP that
          operates the MA you choose to access. Further, you agree not to hold us liable for any mismanagement, misuse,
          or mishandling of this data by the SP, under any circumstances.</p>

          Data You Share</h4>
        <p>You may also choose to provide certain data to the MA, including but not limited to your phone number, text,
          media or locations in order to facilitate the service offered by its SP, or for any other reason as determined
          solely by you. By providing this data to the MA, you are in turn providing it to the SP, which is responsible
          for handling and storing any data provided to it.</p>
        <p>Any processing or collection of data by the SP via MAF is subject to any applicable terms between you and the
          SP. After transmitting it, Telegram does not have any access to or control over data shared between users and
          SP via MAF. Any data that is shared with Telegram itself is governed by the <a href="/privacy">Telegram
            Privacy Policy</a>. Accordingly, you agree not to hold Telegram liable should the SP mismanage, misuse, or
          mishandle the data you provide to it, under any circumstances. </p>
